# Count Coach Web Application (Idea of Launching on Vercel)

This repository contains an early prototype of the Web App Version of Count Coach. The idea was merging the Python logic for audio extraction and beat creation from my Google Colab iterations with React, Next.js (Front end) and Fast API (backend analysis) but it ended up being a bit too complex on merging all of the different facets, so I'm shelving this iteration for right now.
